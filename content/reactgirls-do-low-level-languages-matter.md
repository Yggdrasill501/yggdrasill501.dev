***And what do they theach us?***

This article is my invite junior developers, CS students or anybody who is still sacred of pointers.
I want to motivate you that learning languages like C/C++, Rust, Go or Zig,
not even to use the right tool for the right job,
but also how just learning new languge is making us better developers in our current language

## Motivation
Fundamentals of Programing Languages, book by Ellis Horowitz from 1983.
Aproxymatly two years ago I found this in university library(I still did not return it xD),
and I found very interesting not only because it was amazing mirror into
how old computer world looked like, that only heard in old electro songs by Arpanet,
but the point of view was from linguist angle, which was pointing
how differnt languges like Pascal(yes the language of quiche-eaters),
C(newly cool hypped language) and ADA(the one and only still used by the real programers)
makes you think differtly about the same problems and how with difference in syntax you can
excel in something that befor look like imposible problem.
By this I want to invite and recomend this book to anybody who is curious.

## Js is most popular and sometimes is not enough
Based on all the statictis sicnce 2014 Javascript is still the most popular language, why?
Well becuase we are all soy dev and learning anything that would require more neuron acitivation is too much,
we are all monkeys that hit the spaces and try connect everthing with duck tape, no but seriously Javascript
is super popular beacuse of the easy learing curve, community support and ability to
make fullstack and mobile apps in language.

## Javascript vs everybody

## Where on the web is better to use C, C++, Zig, Rust or Go?

## And where do they makes better in Python or Javascript?
